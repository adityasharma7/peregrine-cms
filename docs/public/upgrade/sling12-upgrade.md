# Sling 9 to Sling 12 Upgrade

This document describes the procedure for upgrading Peregrine CMS from Sling 9
to Sling 12. The upgrade consists of two parts: updating your development 
toolchain and upgrading your repository.

## Who is this document for?

This section is geared towards:
* developers that have been working with Peregrine on Sling 9 and would
  like to move Sling 12, 
* developers that are new to Peregrine and want to start using the latest
  release of Peregrine, and
* site administrators that need to upgrade their existing sites 

## Upgrade Development Toolchain

The toolchain has changed a bit between Sling 9 and Sling 12. The major
changes are the supported versions of Node.js and Java. Please install
the following on your system.

* Java JDK 11
* Node 12.18 LTS

At the time of this writing, there are two main development branches:
* `develop` - Sling 9 branch
* `develop-sling12` - Sling 12 branch

Please switch to the `develop-sling12` branch.
